        <h1>My Favorite Cars From Each Luxury German Brand</h1>
        <h4>Here is a list of my favorite German cars! :)</h4>
    </div>



    <!-- paragraph 1 -->

    <div class="container">
        <div class="box-1">

            <h3>Mercedes-Benz<br></h3>
            <div class="center">
                <p>
                    The first car pictured here is the Mercedes-AMG CLS63s Coupe (yes it is still a coupe even though it
                    has 4 doors!). This is one my favorite cars of all time. It's quite rare compared to other AMGs and
                    it has the sloped-roof look which I feel fits me very well. Under the hood is a 5.5-liter V8, 577
                    horsepower producing MONSTER (a few tunes can take this beast to another level in terms of power and
                    speed). <br><br> Depicted second here is an AMG G63 SUV. This is a very popular car in middle
                    eastern countries such as Dubai and Qatar due to its off-road performance. Dune bashing in this
                    machine is quite the experience and it is also very practical due to its large trunk space. It is
                    also powered by a 4.0-liter V8 pushing out 577 horsepower.
                </p>

        <div class="box-1">
            <h3>Porsche<br></h3>
            <div class="center">
                <p>
                    First from Porsche we have the 911 GT3 RS. It is a legendary track weapon and is fitted with tons of
                    carbon fiber components which make it extremely light and nimble. It is powered by a flat-6 pushing
                    out 518 horsepower. <br><br> Second we have another legendary car <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RurHZGQtbmg" target="_blank">renowned for its speed.</a>
                    The Turbo S has been shown to beat plenty of high-powered supercars, even though it only has a
                    flat-6 turbocharged engine producing 640 horsepower. Also, if you cannot tell by now, I like all my
                    cars in full black.
                </p>

            <h3>Audi<br></h3>
            <div class="center">
                <p>
                    Now, Audi. Audi is well known for having one of the best all-wheel-drive systems in the market,
                    known as Quattro. This makes the RSQ8 one of the most practical cars on this list. Pictured first,
                    this very large family-SUV is the perfect daily driver. Under the hood lies a 4.0-liter V8 making
                    591 horsepower. Car tuning companies such as Mansory have been able to <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQbdvyIQO2o" target="_blank">draw out even more power from
                        the RSQ8s engine.</a> <br><br> Second, we have the Audi RS7. Similar to the CLS, this car is a
                    4-door coupe with that very attractive sloped roofline and quite long body. I have been able to
                    witness many of these in person and they are truly one of the best cars the engineers at Audi have
                    produced. The RS7 contains a 4.0-liter V8 pushing out 591 horsepower.

            <h3>BMW<br></h3>
            <div class="center">
                <p>
                    BMW is not at the top of my list for favorite German brands, but I cannot deny BMW's performance
                    capabilities. First, we have the M4. An inline-6 producing up to 543 horsepower stock. The M4 is a
                    popular tuner car can be modified to produce even more power. <br><br> Next, we have one of the most
                    aggressive looking BMWs ever made, which is why it is my favorite. The X6 M is a powerful beast
                    powered by a large 4.4-liter V8 outputting 617 horsepower. My favorite thing about this car is the
                    SUV coupe style (yes SUVs come in coupe form now). It is hard to display how giant this car actually
                    is without showing it to you in person.
